##
## Local App Set Up

### To run the app locally, execute the following commands:

```bash
docker build -t hafiz-quran .
```
- **Builds the Docker image:** This command compiles the application into a Docker image named hafiz-quran.

- **Uses the Dockerfile:** The build process relies on the Dockerfile in the current directory to determine how to create the image.

- **Packages dependencies:** It includes all necessary dependencies specified in the Dockerfile, ensuring the app is ready to run in any environment.


```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 hafiz-quran
```

- **Runs the Docker container:** This command starts a new container instance of the hafiz-quran image.

- **Maps ports:** It maps port 3000 of the host machine to port 3000 of the container, allowing you to access the app through your browser.

- **Executes the application:** The command runs the application as defined in the image, making it accessible locally at http://localhost:3000.
